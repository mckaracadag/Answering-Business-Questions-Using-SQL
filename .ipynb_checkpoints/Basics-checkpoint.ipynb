Accordingly, our customer base consists of conscious individuals who act selectively and pay attention to their budget. In that case, purchasing the pieces liked from the albums with deeper analysis will significantly reduce our costs. With the profit obtained, wider marketing campaigns can be organized, profitable customer base can be increased and our product range can be expanded. "

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Rock, Alternative & Punk, Metal, and R&B/Soul are among the top-selling music genres in the USA. When R&B/Soul, Blues, Jazz  and similar genres are evaluated together, it is seen that the 4th largest segment is an important market size in R&B and Jazz tours. And even when alternative and easy listening are taken into account, it is easily seen that there is an important audience that likes softer music, unlike rock and metal. The addition of these type albums and tracks from American artists could improve the sales performance of the store.\n",
    "\n",
    "I determined the sales performance of the shop's employees. They were hired same year. The sales performance of employees seems to depend on their hiring dates. Though all of them was hired same year, Jane Peacock has best sale performance at the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noteworthy countries are Czech Republic, Germany, United Kingdom and India. But these data may be deceptive to make decision for those countries. Especially for India with 1.5 billion population and Czech Republic with 10 million, 2 customers are not seen enough for us to make a healthy decision. The sample size is not large enough to give us high confidence. However, it can be said that Czech republic is the most remarkable country in terms of total sales figures, order size per customer and average order size relative to population and customer number. Germany and the United Kingdom can be a safe harbor for familiarity with the musical genre and the values in the current table. We can say that Czech Republic, United Kingdom, and Germany show opportunities for growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "About 20% of total sales come from whole album purchases. 81.4% are the orders consisting of individually selected tracks. Our company especially should continue to selling individual tracks. Our customer base prefer individual tracks liked. In that case, purchasing the pieces liked from the albums with deeper analysis will significantly reduce our costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The artist Iron Maiden is mostly used in the playlists.\n",
    "About half of the available tracks in the store remain unpurchased.\n",
    "The range of tracks in the store mostly reflects the sales performance except Rock, Latin etc. It may rethink about the number of tracks classified under Latin, TV Shows, Drama genres following the observed negative trends in sales. On the other hand, R&B/Soul, Alternative and Blues may offer opportunities. \n",
    "Tracks categorized under non-protected media types are sold better than protected types.\n",
